# Collegiate Advantage
A little while ago, I had a conversation with my cousin and my other cousin's
girlfriend. We had differing beliefs on what sort of advantage your college
and major gets you in your career. I wanted to determine which side had more
truth to it, so I decided to find some data. 

[This data](https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries?select=degrees-that-pay-back.csv)
is from a fairly popular Kaggle dataset published three years ago, which was 
taken from a publication by the Wall Street Journal, sourced by PayScale.
It contains various salary data arranged by school and major. 

My goal is to identify what sort of advantage you get based off of your major 
and school, and to what effect 'prestige' plays into that edge. I want to take
a couple different approaches to this, namely in the way I work with the data. 
I'll start by familiarizing myself with the data in Python, then transition to 
R and eventually a database approach. This is mainly for my own practice, and
also because I want to see what limitations / advantages each of these
approaches offers. 

I'm currently tracking progress on [Trello](https://trello.com/c/ftpQUBiK),
and documenting it in more detail [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12vckl9tqZNVNlNI1I5sL9OwnWX1YAwia597QRnHvzak/edit?usp=sharing)

I'll eventually make a statement about my findings on Medium, and update this
README with a quick glance at the highlights.
